# 📄 Stage 2 – Project Charter: University Chatbot for Students

---

## 1. Project Objectives

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of this project is to develop a chatbot that helps university students get instant and accurate answers to common questions related to university services, deadlines, campus activities, and facilities. This chatbot aims to improve the student experience by providing 24/7 access to university-related information, making it easier and quicker to find the answers students need.

**Objectives (SMART):**  
1- **Improve Student Access to Information**: Provide instant answers to frequently asked questions about campus facilities, academic services, and important deadlines.
2- **Enhance the Student Experience**: Facilitate easy access to a variety of university information without the need for students to navigate multiple sources or wait for staff responses.
3- **Reduce Support Overhead for University Staff**: Minimize repetitive inquiries handled by university staff regarding general and common topics, allowing them to focus on more complex tasks.

## 3. Scope

**In-Scope:**  
- Providing answers to common university-related questions (e.g., campus facilities, deadlines, events). 
- Real-time data regarding university services, facilities (e.g., library, cafeteria), and key events. 
- Web or mobile-friendly interface for students.
- Development of an intuitive user interface that allows students to interact with the chatbot.
- 24/7 availability.  

**Out-of-Scope:**  
- The MVP will not integrate with university systems for personalized student data like grades, course registrations, etc.  
- Advanced features like predictive analytics or voice assistants (future phases).
- No advanced NLP capabilities (e.g., understanding complex questions or casual conversations).  
- Full-scale integration with every university system.
- The chatbot will be available primarily through a web interface, not as a mobile app in this MVP version.
- Multi-Language Support: The MVP will not include multi-language support for international students (will be added later if needed).

## 4. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Limited access to university databases | Medium | Collaborate early with university IT to identify accessible data sources. |
| Student privacy concerns | High | Avoid handling sensitive personal data; comply with data privacy policies. |
| Lack of technical experience in NLP | Medium | Use existing AI frameworks and allocate time for tutorials. |
| Low adoption by students | High | Conduct awareness campaigns and focus on user-friendly design. |

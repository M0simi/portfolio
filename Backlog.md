## 3. MoSCoW Prioritization

### Must Have
- As a student, I want to search for FAQs by keyword, so that I can quickly find answers.  
- As a student, I want to know deadlines of activities/services, so that I don’t miss important dates.  
- As a student, I want to get information about campus facilities (library, cafeteria, gym), so that I can plan my visits.  
- As an admin, I want to add or update FAQs, so that the chatbot always has accurate information.  

### Should Have
- As a student, I want to ask the chatbot general questions about university events and announcements, so that I stay informed and engaged.  
- As a student, I want to access the chatbot from web, so that I can use it wherever I am.  

### Could Have
- As a student, I want to rate chatbot answers, so that future responses can improve.  
- As a student, I want to save frequently asked questions, so that I can access them quickly later.  

### Won’t Have (MVP)
- As a student, I want to interact with the chatbot using voice commands, so that I can have a hands-free experience.  
- As a student, I want the chatbot to access my grades and personal academic data, so that I can get personalized academic insights.  
- As a student, I want the chatbot to speak in multiple languages, so that I can interact in my preferred language.
